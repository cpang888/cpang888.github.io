                            <p>My name is Cindy Pang. I came from Hong Kong and graduated from GA State. I have been working in the software industry 
                                since I grauduated. One fun fact about me is that all the companies I have worked for start with letter 'C'. I worked for Coggins, 
                                CNN, Ciena and now I work for Coca-Cola. My name also starts with 'C'. What's up with that?</p>
                    
                            <p>During my spare time, I enjoy traveling, snow skiing, and tennis. I play ALTA all year round except for the next 6 months. 
                                Because of this certification program, I have decided to skip two ALTA seasons. My team is currently playing at the A2 level. Last season we
                                ended third to last.
                                I can speak three different languages (English, Cantonese, and Marndarin) fluently.  
                                I live in Dekalb county with my husband and son. My son's name is Victor and he is going to UGA this fall.
                                Every year I enjoy going skiing with my friends. We normally go for a week and last year we had about 26 people that went on the 
                                ski trip. </p>
                    
                            <p>I have over 10 years+ of programming experience. I worked on C++, JAVA, JAVA Swing, Adobe Flex, Weblogic server, Oracle, MySQL, etc. 
                                In the Coca-Cola Freestyle, I am a system analyst, technical lead, product owner, and scrum master.
                                The project that I am working on uses the technologies of HTML, Reacts, node, JAVA, and Spring. I familiar with Eclipse, TFS, Git, GitHub, 
                                JIRA, Confluence, Agil methodolog, Windows, and Linux. I would like to get a formal training on the area of web development. 
                                I hope to become an expert on web development after this certification.
                                I am very excited and looking forward to the challenges. 
                            </p>

                            <p>I am part of the Community Outreach Committee in the Coca-Cola Asian American Business Resource Group.
                                I am also volunteering to 
                                help create a web site for the Coca-Cola AABRG.
